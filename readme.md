**DeshCode is an advanced LeetCode-style problem-solving platform.**

The purpose of this project is to build a LeetCode-style backend system that allows users to practice coding challenges, submit solutions, and receive automated feedback. It manages problems, evaluates code against predefined test cases in a secure environment, and keeps track of user submissions. In addition to problem-solving, the system provides a discussion tab where users can exchange ideas and collaborate, and it also supports coding contests, enabling users to compete in real time. Overall, it serves as a complete coding practice, collaboration, and competition platform, simulating a real-world online judge.
