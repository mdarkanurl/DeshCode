# ðŸš€ LeetCode-Style Online Judge

## ðŸ“– Description
This project is a LeetCode-style online coding platform built with Node.js, TypeScript, and Docker. It allows users to:

- Submit and execute code securely in Docker containers.
- Compete in timed contests with real-time leaderboards.
- Discuss solutions and share knowledge in a built-in forum.

The system leverages event-driven architecture with RabbitMQ, CDC with Debezium, Redis for real-time ranking, and PostgreSQL for persistence.

## Features
- Problem solving with instant feedback
- Contest participation with real-time rankings
- Discussion forums for idea exchange
- Scalable architecture to handle a large number of users
- Secure code execution environment with Docker
- Real-time leaderboard updates using Debezium and Kafka
- Message queuing system with RabbitMQ and Kafka
- Real-time data capture and streaming with Debezium and Kafka
- Redis for caching and inhacing performance
- Comprehensive testing with Jest and Supertest
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Containerization with Docker
