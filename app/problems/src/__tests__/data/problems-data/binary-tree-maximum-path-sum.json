  "description": "A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. The path does not need to pass through the root.\n\nThe path sum of a path is the sum of the node values in the path.\n\nGiven the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.",
