  "description": "A character in UTF-8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, and each byte follows specific bit patterns: (1) For 1-byte characters, the first bit is a 0, followed by its 7-bit code. (2) For n-bytes characters (n > 1), the first byte starts with n '1' bits followed by a '0', and the remaining n-1 bytes all start with '10'. Given an array of integers representing bytes (each integer is between 0 and 255), return true if it is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return false.",
